    "description": "Microsoft shares suffered worst drop since 2020 after reporting $37.5B quarterly AI CapEx (up 66% YoY) while Azure growth slowed to 39%. The market is punishing 'blind spending' on AI infrastructure, triggering sector-wide sell-off. Analysts point to 'DeepSeek Shock' as root cause - efficient Chinese models making $100B+ data center build-outs look like over-provisioning.",

    "description": "Reports confirm Nvidia is under fresh US scrutiny for 'supporting' Chinese AI efficiency. According to NVIDIA records, Nvidia personnel helped DeepSeek achieve major training efficiency gains through 'optimized co-design of algorithms, frameworks, and hardware.' DeepSeek-V3 requires only 2.788M H800 GPU hours for full training - less than what U.S. developers typically require for frontier-scale models.",
